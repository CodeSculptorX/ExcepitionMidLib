# ExcepitionMidLib

ExcepitionMidLib is a .NET Core class library designed to handle exceptions in a structured and efficient manner.And ExcepitionMidLib library also for handling global exceptions and maintaining global response. This library is used to generate standardized responses for successful and error scenarios.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **.NET Core**: You should have .NET Core installed on your machine. The library is written in .NET Core, so you need it to use the library.

2. **IDE**: You need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports .NET Core development. Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider are good options.

3. **Knowledge**: Basic knowledge of C# and .NET Core is required to use this library effectively. Familiarity with exception handling in .NET Core would be beneficial.

4. **.NET Core Project**: You need an existing .NET Core project to use this library. The library is not available as a NuGet package and needs to be included directly in your project.

Please ensure all these prerequisites are met before attempting to use the `ExcepitionMidLib` library.

## Structure

The library is organized into several key components:

1. **Builder/middleware/ExceptionMiddlewareExtensions.cs**: This class contains the `UserExceptionHandler` method, which sets up the middleware for handling API exceptions.

2. **common/Constants.cs**: This file defines several constants that are used as JSON keys in API error and response messages.

3. **Exception**: This directory contains several classes related to exception handling:
    - **APIException.cs**: This class is a custom exception designed to handle API errors. It inherits from the `BaseException` class.
    - **BaseException.cs**: This class serves as the base class for other exception classes in the library.
    - **DatabaseException.cs**: This class handles exceptions related to database operations.
    - **Error.cs**: This class represents an error in the application.
    - **ExceptionOptions.cs**: This class provides configurable options for exceptions, such as default error codes.

4. **Middleware/ExceptionHandler/APIExceptionResponceMiddleware.cs**: This class is a middleware that handles API exceptions and formulates a response.
5. **Models/HttpActionResponce.cs**: This class represents the HTTP response from an action. It includes properties such as `TrackingId`, `UserMessage`, `DeveloperMessage`, `Data`, and `StatusCode`.


## Usage

To use this library, simply include it in your .NET Core project and configure the middleware to use the `UserExceptionHandler` method from `ExceptionMiddlewareExtensions.cs`.

Here's an example of how to register the library in your application:

```csharp
app.UserExceptionHandler(options =>
{
    options.DefaultInternalServerErrorCode = 500;
    options.DefaultDatabaseErrorCode = 400;
});
```

### Response

An error response includes the following fields:

- `trackingid`: A unique identifier for tracking the error.
- `usermessage`: A user-friendly error message.
- `developerMessage`: A developer-specific error message.
- `data`: Additional data related to the error.
- `statuscode`: The HTTP status code indicating the type of error.

Example Error Response:

```json
{
  "trackingid": "ea9e0805-f615-486c-913a-13c09baa30fe",
  "usermessage": "Product is not exists.",
  "developerMessage": null,
  "data": null,
  "statuscode": 406
}
```
Successful Response

```json
{
  "trackingId": "85fef669-292f-4dbb-8f2c-888e8fc88cbd",
  "userMessage": null,
  "developerMessage": null,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "productname": "Mango",
      "price": 0,
      "productdetails": "Mongo product"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "productname": "Apple",
      "price": 56,
      "productdetails": "Apple product"
    }
  ],
  "statusCode": 200
}
```
